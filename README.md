#  Project: Docker + CICD + Terraform + AWS  

This project demonstrates how to deploy a simple microservices application from local development to the cloud using modern DevOps tools and practices.  

The application is a lightweight Flask web app (Python) that uses Redis as an in-memory cache to track visitor counts. While the app itself is simple, the focus of this project is on showcasing **cloud deployment workflows, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and CI/CD pipelines**.  

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Containerized Application**: Flask app with Redis cache for visitor counting
- **CI/CD Automation**: GitHub Actions builds and pushes Docker images to AWS ECR
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform provisions AWS resources efficiently
- **AWS Deployment**: ECS Fargate orchestrates containers in a two-tier architecture (public/private subnets)
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose allows easy microservices testing

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Docker & Docker Compose** â€“ Multi-stage builds, local testing
- **Python (Flask)** â€“ Lightweight web application
- **Redis** â€“ In-memory cache for visitor tracking
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ CI/CD automation
- **AWS Services**:
  - ECS Fargate
  - ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
  - VPC with public & private subnets
  - Redis cache in private subnet
- **Terraform** â€“ Infrastructure provisioning as code

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Overview
1. **Develop**: Flask + Redis app tracks visitor counts  
2. **Containerize**: Optimize Docker images using multi-stage builds  
3. **Local Test**: Use Docker Compose to connect Flask and Redis locally  
4. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions builds & pushes Docker images to AWS ECR  
5. **Provision**: Terraform creates VPC, ECS Fargate services, and Redis in private subnet  
6. **Deploy**: App runs on AWS with a secure two-tier architecture
